            <p class="text-left">
              We want to encourage teens to open up to conversation about AIDS/HIV and not let the stigma that follows it stand in the way. We motivate people to open up their minds and realize the importance of discussion and acceptance in today’s society. Open Up pushes people to be open to accepting help and assistance, and points them to these resources.
